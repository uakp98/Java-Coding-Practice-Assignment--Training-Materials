### Java Coding Practice Assignments (Topic: Conditional Statement)
<ol>
  <li>Take two int values from user and print greatest among them.</li>
  <li>Take three int values from user and print greatest among them.</li>
  <li>Write a Java program to get a number from the user and print whether it is positive or negative.</li>
  <li>Take an input value from user and check the status of grade in the following order- <br>
  (If the percentage is above 90, assign grade ‘A+’, If the percentage is above 75, assign grade ‘A’, If the percentage is above 65, assign grade ‘B+’, If the percentage is above 50, assign grade ‘B’, If the percentage is above 35, assign grade ‘C’, Below 35, Fail)</li>
  <li>Take one int value from user and print if it’s Even or Odd no. (using if-else and Switch case)</li>
  <li>Take values of length and breadth of a rectangle from user and check if it is square or not.</li>
  <li>Write a program to check if a year is leap year or not.<br>
(If a year is divisible by 4 then it is leap year but if the year is century year like 2000, 1900, 2100 then it must be divisible by 400.)</li>
  <li>Write a Java program to find the number of days in a month</li>
  <li>Create a calculator by using if-else statement and Switch case</li>
  <li>A shop will give discount of 10% if the cost of purchased quantity is more than 1000.<br>
Ask user for quantity<br>
Suppose, one unit will cost 100.<br>
Judge and print total cost for user.</li>
  <li>A company decided to give bonus of 5% to employee if his/her year of service is more than 5 years.
Ask user for their salary and year of service and print the net bonus amount.</li>
  <li>A school has following rules for grading system:<br>
a. Below 25 - F<br>
b. 25 to 45 - E<br>
c. 45 to 50 - D<br>
d. 50 to 60 - C<br>
e. 60 to 80 - B<br>
f. Above 80 - A<br>
Ask user to enter marks and print the corresponding grade. (using Switch case only)</li>
  <li>Take input of age of 3 people by user and determine oldest and youngest among them.</li>
  <li>A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendance is less than 75%.<br>
Take following input from user<br>
Number of classes held<br>
Number of classes attended.<br>
And print<br>
percentage of class attended<br>
Is student is allowed to sit in exam or not.</li>
  <li>Modify the above question to allow student to sit if he/she has medical cause. Ask user if he/she has medical cause or not (‘Y' or 'N’) and print accordingly.</li>
  <li>A 4-digit number is entered through keyboard. Write a program to print a new number with digits reversed as of original one. E.g.-<br>
INPUT: 1234        OUTPUT: 4321<br>
INPUT: 5982        OUTPUT: 2895</li>
  <li>A four digit number ABCD is called Lucky number if A+B=C+D<br>
(Example- 3719 is a Lucky number as 3+7=1+9 but 3521 is not a Lucky Number as 3+5 != 1+9)</li>
  <li>Write a Java program that takes the user to provide a single character from the alphabet. Print Vowel or Consonant, depending on the user input. If the user input is not a letter (between a and z or A and Z), or is a string of length > 1, print an error message.</li>
</ol>  <br><br>
  
  
  

### Java Coding Practice Assignment (Topic: Looping Statement)
 <ol>
   <li>Write a program which prints the even numbers between 1 and 100 in an increasing order</li>
   <li>Take 10 integers from keyboard using loop and print their average value on the screen.</li>
   <li>Calculate the sum of digits of a number given by user. E.g.-<br>
INUPT : 123        OUPUT : 6<br>
INUPT : 12345        OUPUT : 15</li>
   <li>Write a program which reads a sequence of integers from the user and stop by displaying “Done” when the sum of these values exceeds 100.</li>
   <li>Write a program which displays the sum of the strict divisors of an integer given by the user. <br>
(Ex.- input-6 ->divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 ; by adding them we can get 1+2+3=6 ;So 6 will be the output<br>
input-10 ->divisors of 6 are 1,2,5 ; by adding them we can get 1+2+5=8 ;So 8 will be the output)</li>
   <li>Write a program which reads a positive number N from the user then indicates if N is prime or not.</li>
   <li>Write a program to print all prime number in between 1 to 100.</li>
   <li>Write a program which reads an integer n and displays the n-th Fibonacci number.</li>
   <li>Write a program which displays a string with a space after each character. <br>
(Ex.- abcd -> a b c d)</li>
  <li>Write a program which displays the reverse of a String. (Ex.- abcd -> dcba)</li>
  <li>Factorial of any number n is represented by n! and is equal to 1*2*3*....*(n-1)*n. <br>
E.g.-<br>
4! = 1*2*3*4 = 24<br>
3! = 3*2*1 = 6<br>
2! = 2*1 = 2<br>
Also,<br>
1! = 1<br>
0! = 0<br>
Write a Java program to calculate factorial of a number.</li>
   <li>Write a program which finds if a String is a Palindrome String or not.</li>
   <li>A three digit number is called Armstrong number if sum of cube of its digit is equal to number itself.<br>
E.g.- 153 is an Armstrong number because (13)+(53)+(33) = 153.<br>
Write all Armstrong numbers between 100 to 500.</li>
   <li>Draw a 10*10 multiplication table using For loop.</li>
   <li>Print multiplication table of 24, 50 and 29 using loop.</li>

   <li>Take integer inputs from user until he/she presses q ( Ask to press q to quit after every integer input ). Print average and product of all numbers.</li>

   <li>Print the following patterns using loop :<br>
